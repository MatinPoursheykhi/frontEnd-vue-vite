# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

This is a simple frontEnd project based on VUE accompanied by normal css.
in addition, this project has been coded to use rest Api and implement CRUD operations.  Also its dataBase can be on two ways,
1.first way is using json-server {https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server}, which is set on a specific port.
2.second way is backEnd,you can also use your local dataBase which must be sqlServer or mysql,
you can find this mentioned backEnd on my gitHub => (MatinPoursheykhi/backEnd-nodeJs-sequelize)
and clone it.

** you may need to change your dataBase, thus the infrastructures are provided to switch between json-server and your local dataBase.
