# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

This is a simple frontEnd project based on VUE accompanied by normal css. Also its dataBase can be on two ways,
1.first way is using json-server {https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server}, which is set on a specific port.
2.second way is backEnd,you can also use your local dataBase which must be sqlServer or mysql,
you can find this mentioned backEnd on my gitHub => (MatinPoursheykhi/backEnd-nodeJs-sequelize)
and clone it.

** you may need to change your dataBase, thus the infrastructures are provided to switch between json-server and your local dataBase.
